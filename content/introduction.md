# Introduction

Welcome to the TinyDevCRM API! TinyDevCRM serves as your data layer for
lightweight, event-driven clients.

Since this API is defined using HTTP, no SDK is necessary! Your favorite
language's HTTP library should be able to communicate with this API, no problem.
You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the
programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

All project code is open-source, and can be viewed in [this GitHub organization
page](https://github.com/tinydevcrm).

This API documentation page was created with
[DocuAPI](https://github.com/bep/docuapi/), a multilingual documentation theme
for the static site generator [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/).
