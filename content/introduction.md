# Introduction

Welcome to the TinyDevCRM API! You can use our API to create PostgreSQL tables,
create PostgreSQL materialized views, refresh materialized views using a cron
job, and stream materialized view refresh events via HTTP/2 and Server-Sent
Events.

Since this API is defined using HTTP, no SDK is necessary, and your language's
HTTP library should be able to communicate with this API! You can view code
examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming
language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This API documentation page was created with
[DocuAPI](https://github.com/bep/docuapi/), a multilingual documentation theme
for the static site generator [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/).**
